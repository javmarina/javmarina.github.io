title: About me

**I'm Javier Marina!**

A passionate engineer and tech addict.

I have a wide range of interests, from pure programming to robotics, computer vision and deep learning.

I'm an Electronics, Robotics and Mechatronics Engineer by the University of MÃ¡laga ([UMA](https://www.uma.es/)) and have a Master's Degree in Intelligent Systems by the Jaume I University ([UJI](https://www.uji.es/)).

I started programming Android apps in Java (something I still do), and later grew an interest in robotics. In the last few years, I have learned new things in fields not strictly related to robotics, such as the aforementioned.

I'm a curious person and feel intrigated by how things work. I constantly ask myself how to improve the world around me. On a personal level, I usually have a particular focus on efficiency and correctness: _doing things the right way_.
