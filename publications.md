  Experiments that require the use of Supervised Autonomous Underwater Vehicles for Intervention (I-AUV) are not easy to be performed, specially when deployed in the sea or in scenarios where the robot might face lack of space and communication (e.g. interior of pipes). Also, there are some applications where the robots need to cooperate in a closed manner, for example when transporting and assembling big pipes. In fact, these two scenarios are being studied in the context of the H2020-ElPeacetolero and TWINBOT (TWIN roBOTs for cooperative underwater intervention mission) projects, being necessary to have a simulation tool that offer more realistic rendering and being compatible with the real robot Application Programming Interface (API).
